I recently graduated from Harare Institute of Technology with a BTech Honours Degree in Software Engineering. I work mostly with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have experience in React and I have used CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS for over 3 years. I have worked on various web applications and websites over the course of my career so far. I am looking to gain more experience in frontend development especially in areas I have not worked in as much like mobile app development.
